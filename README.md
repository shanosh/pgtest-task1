pgtest-task1
============

This file contains Task 1.2<br/>
This (master) branch is the same as 'task2' branch<br/>


Assumptions<br/>
1. Atleast PHP 5.3 is available in the production setup<br/>
2. PHPUnit is installed and can be run via commandline with the command 'phpunit'<br/>
3. An instance where an integer is a multiple of 3 and 5 (FizzBuzz) is assumed as a consecutive occurance of Fizz/Buzz hence the next integer is printed as 'Bazz'
